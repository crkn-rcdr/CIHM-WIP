CIHM-WIP

This is a module used by Canadiana to process "work in progress" (WIP)
files, and generate a CIHM Submission Information Package (SIP), which
can then be ingested into an Archival Information Package (AIP).


The resulting AIPs are then distributed via code in the separate
CIHM::TDR module.


The scripts in bin/ represent microservices which read from CouchDB databases
what work needs to be done, and submits results back to CouchDB.

* mallet - creates a SIP from supplied files

* tdringest - adds a SIP to an AIP

* wip - command-line interface for some tools

* wip-imageconv - Will convert supplied image files to another format.

* wip-metsproc - extracts descriptive metadata from saved files and loads
                 into CouchDB (preparing for SIP generation)

* wip-move - moves files between different 'stages' used to manage
             processes.

* wip-tdrexport - exports data from repository (metadata, SIP, AIP)

* wip-unitize - helps automate organizing the structure of files.
